THANK YOU SIRüôè
     15 Reply<br> My name is aditya. If some moron teaches you in the name of IIT the video might get thousands or even millions of views. But if a great teacher is explaining the basic concept of Physics, it might only get 8,000 views. It's a loss for science enthusiasts. We confine science only to the careers.  </p>
